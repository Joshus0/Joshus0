### 🐺 About Me

I'm an 18-year-old student at **University of Salerno (UNISA)** with a curiosity that's hard to satisfy.
I've always been the kind of person who wants to know *exactly* how things work under the hood. That's why I love **C** and low-level programming: I want to talk to the machine, not just use it.

Currently, I'm blending my engineering studies with my creative passion: **Game Development**. I believe code is just a tool to create experiences.

* 🔭 **Current Quest:** Mastering pointers and memory management in C.
* 🌱 **Learning Path:** Exploring the math behind Game Engines and Robotics.
* 🎯 **The Dream:** To engineer software that feels alive.
* ⚡ **Offline:** You'll find me thinking about game mechanics or tinkering with hardware.

### 🛠️ The Toolkit

My arsenal is growing. I focus on understanding the fundamentals first.

| Language | Proficiency | My take on it |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **C** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | *The roots.* It teaches me discipline and how memory really works. |
| **Python** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Great for quick scripts and automation. |
| **Java** | ⭐⭐ | Learning OOP patterns and structure. |
| **C++ / C#** | ⚙️ | *Loading...* Studying these for Game Engines (Unity/Unreal). |
