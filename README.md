### 🩸 About Me & The Mission

I'm an 18-year-old Software Engineering student at **University of Salerno (UNISA)**, driven by a need to create immersive experiences, not just consume them.

I don't just study code; I deploy it. While mastering the low-level fundamentals of **C** at university, I founded my own indie game initiative to put theory into practice immediately.

### 🌹 BloodRose Studio

<div align="center">
  
> **"Indie spirit, professional ambition."**

</div>

I am the founder and lead developer of **BloodRose Studio**.
This is where my engineering studies meet creative chaos. We are currently in the R&D phase, conceptualizing our first projects and building the necessary tooling.

* **Role:** Founder & Lead Programmer.
* **Focus:** Developing core gameplay mechanics and custom systems.
* **Status:** Laying the foundations. 🚧

### 🛠️ The Arsenal

My philosophy is to understand the machine deeply (C) to better command the engines later (C++/C#).

#### The Core (Daily Drivers)
* 💻 **C** — My foundation. Learning memory management the hard way to build optimized systems.
* 🐍 **Python** — For quick scripting, automation, and prototyping ideas.

#### The Game Dev Path (Loading...)
* 🎮 **C++ & C#** — Studying modern engine architecture (Unity/Unreal context).
* ☕ **Java** — Exploring Object-Oriented Programming patterns.
